# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The Kickstarter dataset used Excel to see the campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and fundraising goals.

### Purpose
Using charts and graphs along with the the Excel spreadsheet, it made it easier to see of the outcomes by organizing and analyzing the dataset.

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickstarter dataset was fairly easy to work with. The data was simple to understand and needed minimal cleaning.

A column was added to calculate the theater campaign outcomes by month launched, but also added another column for the year of release to complete the pivot table for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date.

It was challenging in typing some formulas, especially in the COUNTIFS formula where one tiny typo could result in no answer or error message of #VALUE

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successful month to launch a campaign appeared to be May. The worst month appeared to be December.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns with goals of less than $1,000, and up to 44,9999 were mostly successful around 67-73% of the time.While the campaigns that had goals of $45,000 or more had failed a 100%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The use of Excel formulas that were never seen before felt foriegn; and at times frustrating when could not get the right formulas to work.

Outside of the SUMS formula, none of the other formulas have been used before.  The COUNTIFS formula was the hardest to work with.

Pivot Tables were new, but after a few tries was able to get the hang of it.

GitHub is new, and seemed easy to work with at the time

Writing this report was challenging as this is a first and not really sure if providing the correct information. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 The chance of campaigns being cancelled is low.  There were only seven occurrences
 The less money the campaign the more likely to succeed.
 
 - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The campaigns with goals less than $45,000 had a higher success rate than those that had goals of more than $45,000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
